				COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms,
				but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of
				illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new,
				returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being
				infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical
				conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and

				sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily
				available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Click this text to read more!
